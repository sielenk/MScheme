# MScheme

## What is MScheme?

MScheme is a Scheme interpreter implemented in Java. The project goals are

* to comply with the Revised<sup>5</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme,
* to develop a modular, clear and object-oriented design based on the core-scheme defined
  in the article <em>Proper Tail Recursion and Space Efficiency</em> by William Clinger and
* to implement it (in Java for now).
